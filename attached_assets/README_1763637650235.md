- **Marketing**: Promotional materials, signage, brochures, digital assets

### Velocity Classifications
- **Fast-moving**: High-frequency items requiring frequent replenishment
- **Medium**: Regular consumption items with moderate turnover
- **Slow**: Low-frequency items with predictable usage patterns
- **Very-slow**: Occasional items with minimal consumption
- **Once in a while**: Rare items used for special occasions

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Charts**: Chart.js for interactive data visualization
- **Icons**: Font Awesome for consistent iconography
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with CSS Grid, Flexbox, and CSS Variables
- **Animations**: CSS Keyframes and JavaScript-driven particle effects

## 📊 Data Structure

### Synthetic Data Generation
The application generates realistic synthetic data for all filter periods:

```javascript
{
  daily: {
    matrix: { /* 6 categories × 5 velocities */ },
    outputs: { outliers, normal, delayed, exceptions },
    kpis: { utilization, cost, wastage }
  },
  // ... weekly, monthly, yearly
}
```

### Bubble Status Logic
- **Normal (Green)**: 80-100% efficiency, slow blinking
- **Warning (Orange)**: <80% efficiency, medium blinking  
- **Critical (Red)**: >100% consumption, fast blinking
